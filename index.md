## Workshop on Future Internet Research Directions

Mar 13, 2026 
Shenzhen International Graduate School, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen
[http://hkirw.github.io/2026](http://hkirw.github.io/2026)

Built on the huge success of the [HKIRW 2024](http://hkirw.github.io/2024) and [HKIRW 2025](http://hkirw.github.io/2025), in the week before the [IETF-125 meeting in Shenzhen](https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/125/), this workshop aims to bring together researchers in computer networking and systems around the globe to a live forum discussing innovative ideas at their early stages. 
The mission of the workshop is that promising but not-yet-mature ideas can receive timely feedback from the community and experienced researchers, leading them into future IRTF work, Internet Drafts, or IETF working groups.

The workshop will operate like a “one day [Dagstuhl](https://www.dagstuhl.de/) seminar” and will focus on discussion and ideas exchange and less on conference-style presentations. The objective is to identify topics and connect like-minded people for potential future collaboration.

## Topics of Interest
